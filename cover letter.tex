\noindent Dear Editor,
\\
\\
\indent Please find enclosed the manuscript of an original research work, entitled \textit{``Null controllability of a nonlocal heat equation with integral kernel''}, which I am submitting for consideration of publication as an article in Systems \& Control Letters.
\\
\indent This is a joint work with V\'ictor Hern\'andez-Santamr\'ia, from University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain.
\\
\indent This work addresses the problem of the controllability of a nonlocal heat equation involving an integral kernel, through a Carleman approach. To my knowledge, the work is new, and I believe that this paper is appropriate for publication in your journal. 
\\
\indent This manuscript has not been published and is currently not submitted elsewhere.
\\
\indent Thank you for considering this work. Please, address all the correspondence concerning this manuscript to me as the corresponding author and feel free to correspond with me by email address.
